// Session state machine + persistence.
//
// One session is active at a time. Holds an in-memory active session id pointer
// plus a heartbeat timestamp; everything else is reconciled against SQLite on each
// transition so a crash midway through can be recovered on next boot.
//
// Multi-tab handling:
// - tab_states keeps the most recent heartbeat per tab_id (across all bridge clients)
// - record_heartbeat updates the cache but does NOT immediately flip session status
// - apply_aggregate_state, called from a background tick, aggregates across all
//   recent tabs and applies a single status update. This kills the "flipping
//   between active/paused" you'd otherwise get with multiple Stash tabs open.
// - Per-scene seconds_tracked is only credited when TWO consecutive heartbeats
//   from the SAME tab on the SAME scene both report state=playing. One-off
//   "playing" blips from autoplay don't add time.
