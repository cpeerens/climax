<!--
  First-launch setup wizard. Shown once on a fresh install (real profile) over the
  dashboard; boot forces the dashboard window so it's seen. Flow:
    welcome -> connect (Stash URL + key, tested) -> bridge (install the Stash
    plugin) -> import (mirror sync) -> estimate (bulk reconstruction) -> done.
  Welcome also carries the host-vs-client fork: someone who already runs a Climax
  server has no library to set up here, and every step past this one would write
  to a local DB that goes unread the moment they switch. So they get out at the
  top rather than discovering the connect step's "skip for now" - which asks a
  different question (Stash isn't up yet, I'll do this later).

  Connect is required to advance (with a low-key "skip for now" that re-arms the
  wizard next launch); the bridge / import / estimate steps are skippable. The
  estimate step carries the honesty disclaimer that Stash logs WHEN you watched,
  not how long each sitting was, so the sessions are best-guesses (tagged
  "estimated", editable).

  Re-runnable from Settings -> General, which passes `canCancel` so an X and
  Escape close it outright. A first run gets neither - there is nothing to go
  back to. Note the re-run does NOT clear `onboarding_completed` first: it used
  to, which meant backing out left setup marked unfinished and the wizard fired
  on every launch until you walked it to the end. The flag now only ever moves
  to true, when Finish runs.
