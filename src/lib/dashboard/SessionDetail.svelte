<!--
  Session detail — central scrollable time-spine with alternating cards
  on either side. Scenes are anchored at their first_seen_at along the
  spine; their tracked watch-duration is rendered as a coral band on the
  spine itself. Cumshots show as droplets on the spine at their exact
  occurred_at. Bigger cards (proper thumbnails) alternate L/R and shift
  down when same-side neighbours would overlap. Connector lines (CSS
  divs, L-shape when shifted) join each card back to its spine anchor.

  Zoom controls in the header scale the spine (px per hour). The whole
  panel takes ~80vh; the spine itself scrolls inside the body.

  Expanded inline below the SessionStrip when the user clicks a session.

  // play per player load that crosses its minimum-play-percent, which is exactly
  // "I opened this again" - so a scene shows twice here precisely when Stash
  // counts it twice, and the two apps can be checked against each other.
  //
  // This deliberately replaced a gap heuristic (a long pause, or another scene
  // playing in between). That could not tell a pause from a reload, and it got
  // it BACKWARDS when two scenes played at once: with a tab left running in the
  // background, the other scene's playback sat between this one's runs and read
  // as a return, while the scene that really was re-opened showed as one. Tested
  // against a real session, it inverted both scenes.
